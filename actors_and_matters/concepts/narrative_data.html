	<h1>Narrative and Data</h1>

	<p>This is a very rough draft and an attempt to treat this subject with some degree of formality.  For a more cogent but less formal exposition, see my essay <a href = "../../essays/narrative_engineering.html">Narrative Engineering</a>.

	<h2>Narrative Is Material</h2>

	<p>When most people hear the word "narrative" they think of one of two things: either some kind of fictional story, or some kind of summary or abstract interpretation of the underlying causality behind events.  The former is a special kind of narrative, the latter is not a narrative at all but a model.  A narrative is a series of events contextualized by some conflict, and these events may or may not be "fictional".</p>

	<p>A narrative requires two ingrdients: actors and a text.  The text is the "script" on which actors base their enactments, but since a script can only provide constraints on how you act it out and not dictate every last movement of your muscles, there is not only always room for interpretation, there is no choice but to interpret it in some way by choosing how to act out the script.</p>

	<p>The most obvious example of a narrative in this case is a play: the text is the script that the actors read from, and the actors are, well, the actors.  But it's worth noting that the narrative is <i>not</i> the script or anything "inside" the script, it's the actions that actually play out before the audience's eyes.  Yes, there are fictional backstories and the like, but these things are themselves just a script for the audience's own engagement with the actors;in this sense, the audience are also actors, and one can take note of the fact that it was only very recently that drama involved any kind of unequivocal "fourth wall": perhaps you don't get up and interact with characters in a Shakespeare play, but they do not necessarily confine themselves to some invisible box either.</p>

	<p>Another type of narrative of course is the work of fiction, but this should be seen as a very special evolutionary branch of narrative.  The text is the book, but what about the actors?  In one sense, "you" are the only actor, processing it all through your brain, but your brain itself is but a physical substrate and in fact itself part of the text, as it actually itself completes the substrate in such a way that fictional characters can play out the story.</p>

	<p>At this point, this may seem a bit loopy but bear with me: the characters themselves are interpretive agents insofar that they are attempting to resolve a conflict by making sense of and acting on their situation.  The same could hypothetically be said of the characters actors represent in a play, but really for that period of time those actors <i>are</i> the characters insofar that they fully live those lives according to a set of rules dictated by the script and the rules of acting out that script (for example, if you get mock-stabbed, you're supposed to crumple over, but nobody is supposed to use a real knife.)</p>

	<p>Even in our everyday life we run on the narratives that bind society together, where rituals provide a script that allows us to continually maintain a certain mythology on which things are premised.  In all of these cases, there is still a distinction between the <i>discourse</i>, the way in which things are told, and the <i>fabula</i>, the narrative "content", such as the world that a fictional story would take place in.  The discourse is merely the enactments, with discourse being the <a href="enactments_kernels.html">kernel</a> of these enactments.</p>

	<p>And this is not just limited to things that we colloquially think of as art, this is also the basis for how something like science is conducted.  The various tacit practices of a scientific paradigm are its discourse, with the underlying scientific theories being proven or verified the fabula.  The actors are of course the scientists and all those who support them, and the text is the various formally defined methodologies as well as the instruments that are used to conduct experiments and make observations.</p>

	<p>A narrative continues so long as there are increasing levels of agency, with the climax being the point of maximal entropy, after which the possibilities start to narrow in a process of denoument.  In the example of drama, I do not need to explain where the climax is, whereas in the case of scientific paradigms, the climax comes at the time of scientific crisis, where the paradigm has reached the limits of what it can discover and a new theory is needed to engender new fruitful questions.</p>

	<h2>Data Are Limits</h2>

	<p>Because narratives are a process of increasing agency/entropy, they are divergent phenomena, which is what makes them more than a text in the first place.  If one's reading of a text inevitably leads to some point, in other words, it <a href="../appendix/convergence.html">converges</a>, this is what one calls a datum.  Without data, there would be no science: scientific paradigms are narratives, but parts of them narrow down into stable forms that can be utilized to keep the show going.  But the differnce between data and narrative should be understood to be a formal one: it is a question of whether the information is in the journey or in the destination.</p>
