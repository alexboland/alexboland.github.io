	<h1>Enactments and Kernels</h1>

	<p>The canonical idea of science, and by and large its foundational assumption with the possible exception of quantum physics, is that knowledge comes first and foremost from the information provided to us by our sensees, and that by comparing and contrasting these observations in nuanced and rigorous ways we can uncover how it works and by extension what it truly is independently of any of our biases or limitations.  This notion goes all the way back to Plato, who described the idea with the following metaphor: we are inside a cave, facing a wall on which a light is shone and shadows can be seen.  We cannot directly see the objects casting the shadows, but by observing the patterns in the shadows and applying our intellectual faculties to their various shapes and movements, we can get an idea of what that object is.</p>

	<p>Philosophy, being what it is, did not always take this notion for granted: Descartes asked how one could know for sure their life wasn't an illusion cast by a demon (now retold today as the "brain in a jar" hypothesis), Hume complained that we only observe events and superimpose a pattern that fits them but can never actually know the underlying causality and by extension had no reason to believe we had any knowledge about what would happen next.  These qualms, despite revealing fundamental issues that science simply glossed over, nonetheless bought into the same underlying axiomization of observations as a set of irreducible building blocks on which knowledge is built.  Other thinkers such as Spinoza and Kant challenged these assumptions with ontological frameworks that acknowledged and attempted to satisfactorily account for the inseparability of one's observations and the ideas that frame these observations, but Plato's legacy was ultimately amplified by and adapted to the enlightenment project of finding the unequivocal truth about the universe through the miracle of induction: the belief that one can ultimately corroborate how things truly work from the collective weight of past observations.</p>

	<p>And why should it have gone any other way?  This mythology has proven fruitful beyond any shadow of a doubt, with all kinds of universal laws that have unceasingly demonstrated their reliability and applicability without skipping a beat.  Some of them may prove to be a bit more complicated in the long run, such as Newton's laws giving way to relativity in the aforementioned exmaple, but their unquestionable efficacy reduces questions of "how do we really know?" to little more than angst.  In pretty much every other domain, we haven't seen quite this same degree of certainty, but common sense by and large tells us there's an objective world outside of us that we can understand through observation, and to idly kvetch about this is a waste of time and energy.  Anyone who uses "subjectivity" as a bludgeon to categorically deny the law of gravity is free to jump off a building and tell me how it went.</p>

	<p>The logical and philosophical shortcomings of these ideas brought up by various philosophers nonetheless shows that there are some troubling limitations, and while the fiction of Plato's cave has proven itself extremely effective on countless occasions, our methods have increasingly faltered in the face of more complex problems and in many cases have demonstrated an utter lack of vocabulary to address difficult questions that cannot be separated from notions that were previously dismissed as "subjective". The only way to avoid the lose-lose choice of blind faith in induction and debilitating arbitrary skepticism is to carerfully deconstruct the very concept of observation in order to find more fundamental principles.</p>

	<h2>Observation Is Not Passive</h2>

	<p>One of the earliest obstacles to robotic vision was figuring out how to get robots to reliably recognize objects.  This might seem like something trivial, but it's far from that: image recognition algorithms for 2d images are still notoriously bad at properly identifying what the images are about.  Some of this is due to the complexity of how we name and conceptualize things beyond our immediate sensory impressions, but even basic obstacle avoidance in robots proved not as trivial as people imagined.  The reason why is that a single 2-dimensional snapshot of something often provides insufficient information for knowing what it is.  Consider the example of a table:</p>

	[insert the table image here]

	<p>From a stationary point of view, there are many different things that the two dimensional grid of light hitting the eye could corroborate.  The only way to get an idea of what it is is to find a way to narrow it down.  Luckily, there's an easy way to do this: change your point of view and see which new observations don't match your hypothesis.  By moving your body or even just your eyeballs, you can quickly figure out what the actual object is.</p>

	<p>This is the source of optical illusions; two dimensional images lack the constraints that would allow us to rule out what they would "be" in three dimensions, thus allowing for multiple contradicting interpretations.  A paucity of information forces interpretation, and as such we have to actively decide what something is.  We often think of interpretation as a passive exercise going on between our ears, but this is mere icing on the cake: every time someone or something has to act on incomplete information, it is interpreting.</p>

	<p>Because of this, our sensory apparatus is not naively separable from our locomotion or our cognition.  Nor is there any reason why any given act of sensing necessarily involves what one would consider a "representation", let alone a "truthful" one: if some sea creature is mechanically compelled to move away because some neuron is fired as a result of some simple light-detector being blocked, then so long as this keeps them alive long enough to reproduce, there's no reason why they or their descendents <i>must</i> "see" the world at all beyond the simple causality of this reflex.  But while there may be nothing that we would ever think of as a representation, there <i>is</i> an interpretation insofar that it does something in resposne to a stimulus.</p>

	<p>Does this mean that there is no representation, let alone any way to objectively observe something, but only Skinnerian stimulus-response?  Not exactly: to go back to the example of the table, we can infer a consistent object because we see what does and doesn't change as our own interactions with it vary.  The feedback that doesn't change is the <i>invariance</i> upon which we develop a consistent idea, a <i>representation</i>, of that table.  There's nothing fake about this representation, it's just that rather than existing anywhere in the chain of events, it instead exists as a symmetry across these interactions.</p>

	<p>But is this representation objectively true?  Is it not the case that any representation we see might be inextricable from the prejudices that helped our evolutionary ancestors survive?  This is jumping the gun: prejudice is not some lens that distorts an otherwise faithful representation, it's a property inherent to action.  To revsit our simple sea creature, there's no right or wrong answer about what the stimulus ostensibly stands for: anything could have blocked its light and the sea creature survives by acting in a way that from our point of view "assumes the worst"; but it's not as if it's failing to be "objective", it just doesn't have any other information to act on!  Representation, being the invariance one finds <i>across</i> responses, is in fact a <i>recognition</i> of prejudice by virtue of demonstrating the existence of something independently of the baggage of any one interaction.  A coat rack from a certain distance and angle might look like a person, but once you look at it from other angles, the prejudice of that particular vantage point vanishes, you might reflexively see the pattern again from that angle but all of your behavior will be inevitably based on the coat rack being just that.</p>

	<p>That's not to say that finding such invariances on one scale means one has found what would qualify as "objective" at some larger scale: objectivity on the scale of, say, a group of people, would be made up of relationships that hold across the entire group; money, whether printed or made of gold, most definitely has objective value insofar that regardless of what any one person thinks, it would continue to work exactly the same way with the exact same accessibility.  It's not even enough to say "if everyone stopped believing in it"--everyone would have to stop *using it* for it to stop working, and that doesn't happen without extreme circumstances because people have lives to live.  It's not just that things are objective despite being constructions, things are objective <i>because</i> Objectivity is constructed through and constituted as patterns of <i>action</i>.</p>

	<p>Similarly, the representation of the table requires what Deleuze calls an <i>active synthesis</i>--one only perceives this consistent phenomenon by actively changing their point of view in a sufficient variety of ways.  Insofar that these enactments reliably <a href="../appendix/convergence.html">converge</a> on some stable pattern regardless of where they may have started from, one actively constructs the invariance that constitutes this pattern.  By pattern, I don't mean a pattern of stimuli, but a pattern of <i>action</i>; as in the coat rack example, you can still see optical illusions even if you know that they're illusions; what matters is that for all intents and puproses your behavior proceeds <i>as if</i> the coat rack is just as coat rack.  A representation, existing coextensively with some such behavioral invariance, is a <i>kernel</i>, of sensorimotor enactments.</p>

	
	<h2>Enactment All The Way Down</h2>

	<p>In the two examples above, I refer to certain types of physical action, but the terms "action" and "enactment" are a bit vague: an action isn't always something with a straightforwardly physical description; actions like insulting or praising are defined around social relationships while other actions like paying taxes are defined around the lived abstraction of currency and so on *Zizek sniff*.  The description of how one infers a table also implies a continuous geometric space while the example of the sea creature frames an action every bit as spatial as if it were an algorithm made up of discrete steps.  All of these different descriptions are not only valid in their own right, but at least in my opinion the best way to describe them, but how does one reconcile them so they fit a common concept?</p>

	<p>I've been using "action" and "enactment" interchangeably for lack of any need to do otherwise, but a more nuanced definition of the latter can clear up how one can describe actions in these formally different ways while still talking about them on the same terms: an enactment is a <i>trajectory</i> defined first and foremost by its ends.  For example, one has some reason that compels them to make a sandwich and some end result, between which all sorts of things may appear.  Perhaps it's as simple as carrying out what amounts to an algorithm, but it might also be the case that something comes up: a lack of bread means that a trip to the store becomes a new subtask within this larger endeavor.  In addition to all this, there is always some kind of irreducible physicality not necessarily warranting description, but nonetheless not only still real but always at least a little bit capable of some novel deviation that may have consequences beyond the formal description.</p>

	<p>For this reason, no enactment is an irreducible atomic unit, nor does it contain any such units.  Unlike a line of code, which either runs or doesn't, there's no instant "jump", it's ultimately continuous.  If I choose to swing my arm, I always begin the enactment but it might be cut off by some object that got in the way, or I might successfully carry it out to completion, and no matter what happens there is no way to rewind or pause what transpires.  As circumstances mean that it may or may not require that certain conditions be met, it is not defined as a predictable linear series of steps, but always from the outside in, starting from formally defined ends and "filled in" with other enactments or raw physical execution that has no formally definable content but is still necessary for filling in any gaps.</p>

	<p>The formal ends of the enactment define the "meaning" of any action happening within by embedding it in the context of that trajectory, acting as what Aristotle calls "final cause" and what Kant calls the <i>synthetic a-priori</i>&mdash;the whole defining the ontological nature of the parts.  These formal ends themselves are in turn defined by conflict that embeds them, and the simultaneous construction of and movement through this trajectory, the enactment, constitutes an <i>active synthesis</i> per the above mention of said concept.  This active synthesis is what dictates our interpretation of stimuli, reflected in both the enactment's formal properties and material accidents alike.</p>

	<p>When our actions converge to some sort of stable pattern amongst themselves, this is a kernel.  The perception of a table through eye and body movements is one such example, but so is the stable ability to buy and sell things with legal tender, the regulation of body temperature and pH levels, the maintenance of a daily routine, the ability to navigate through a space, the ability to do math either on paper or in one's head, or even the understanding of the idea of a triangle (try picturing a triangle with angles adding up to more than 180 degrees, you can't.)</p>

	<p>Of course, not all enactments converge, and some even seem to converge only to be invalidated in the end: financial markets, to take one example, have unpredictable wild swings that are so big they can wipe out decades of "reliable" gains, and the same can be seen in a lot of "natural" phenomena as well.  This kind of "invalidation" of kernels in fact inevitably happens with the deterioration of the kernel's substrate: you can't regulate your pH level or know what a triangle is once you're dead, and even if gains are wiped out, some pocket of stable gains did exist for a time; they just weren't a kernel of <i>your</i> enactments.  There is nothing wrong with this, our lives are themselves trajectories with a beginning and an end, and these various kernels are pockets of stability that aid us in not only finding a satisfying resolution to our own story, but in finding kernels common to our collective trajectories that may in turn further the story of one's family, one's civilization, one's values, or the biosphere we all inhabit.</p>

	<p>In the realm of scientific discovery, such kernels exist by virtue of the collective behavior, interpretation, and mechanics of the various instruments, practices, and literature that together converge on laws so fundamental that we can explain large swaths of reality, but even then Newton's laws cannot simply be applied atom by atom to complex phenomena that continue to baffle our best engineers to this day.  These laws are objectively true in the sense talked about above, but their objectivity is contingent on idealizations that cannot be pratically distilled from many of the situations we inhabit in our physical world, thus necessitating that we not see them as the "true" form but only as extremely powerful kernels.</p>

	<p>By seeing theory as the distillation and refinement of practice rather than its progenitor, we effectively reverse Plato's arrow: forms are no less real, but they are constructed.  This is not a dismissal of epistemology, but a celebration of just how powerful it really is.  We need not angst about the impossibility of induction when the key to knowledge has alweays been the limitless power of invention.</p>
