	<h1>Enactments and Kernels</h1>

	<h2>The Problem With Platonism</h2>

	<p>The foundational assumption in almost all philosophy, and pretty much all science with the possible exception of quantum physics, is that knowledge is about using the evidence of our senses combined with logical inference about these observations to uncover the unvarying laws behind what something is and how it works.  This notion goes all the way back to Plato, who described the idea with the following metaphor: we are inside a cave, facing a wall on which a light is shone and shadows can be seen.  We cannot directly see what is casting the shadows, but by observing the patterns in the shadows and applying our intellectual faculties to their various shapes and movements, we can find out what the object is.</p>

	<p>In this metaphor, the shadows are the phenomena in the world we observe, and the source of these shadows are the noumena, the things in themselves.  I am, just as an aside, vastly oversimplifying and drawing on philosophers that came after Plato, but the basic idea nonetheless holds that there are appearances that we observe and that there is an underlying observer-independent meaning that one could hypothetically deduce.  More specifically, the shadows represent objects that are instantiations of the form, and the objects casting the shadows are the pure form of the object. </p>

	<p>In classical physics, this underlying mythology has proven to be extremely fruitful, with all kinds of universal laws rigorously proven: we have found, for example, Newton's laws, and later the theory of relativity, to be the form underlying all movement through space and time.  Some of them may prove to be a bit more complicated in the long run, such as Newton's laws giving way to relativity in the aforementioned exmaple, but there is a degree of reliability and applicability that is unquestionable and reduces questions of "how do we really know?" to little more than angst.  In pretty much every other domain, we haven't seen quite this same degree of certainty, but common sense by and large tells us there's an objective world outside of us that we can understand through observation, and to idly kvetch about this is a waste of time and energy.</p>

	<p>That being said, the pretense that knowledge is a matter of observing phenomena and inferring noumena has a lot of foundational problems that can lead to practical problems down the road:</p>

	<h3>Problem 1: Observation Is Not Passive</h3>

	<p>One of the earliest obstacles to robotic vision was figuring out how to get robots to reliably recognize objects.  This might seem like something trivial, but it's far from that: image recognition algorithms for 2d images are still notoriously bad at properly identifying what the images are about.  Some of this is due to the complexity of how we name and conceptualize things beyond our immediate sensory impressions, but even basic object avoidance in robots proved not as trivial as people imagined.  The reason why is that a single 2-dimensional snapshot of something often provides insufficient information for knowing what it is.  Consider the example of a table:</p>

	[insert the table image here]

	<p>From a stationary point of view, there are many different things that the two dimensional grid of light hitting the eye could corroborate.  The only way to get an idea of what it is is to find a way to narrow it down.  Luckily, there's an easy way to do this: change your point of view and see which new observations don't match your hypothesis.  By moving your body or even just your eyeballs, you can quickly figure out what the actual object is.</p>

	<p>This is the source of optical illusions; two dimensional images lack the constraints that would allow us to rule out what they would "be" in three dimensions, thus allowing for multiple contradicting interpretations.  A paucity of information forces interpretation, and as such we have to actively decide what something is.  We often think of interpretation as a passive exercise going on between our ears, but this is mere icing on the cake: every time someone or something has to act on incomplete information, it is interpreting.</p>

	<p>Because of this, our sensory apparatus is not naively separable from our locomotion or our cognition.  All of our senses evolved from mechanisms that helped our predecessors respond to external stimuli in more adaptive ways, to which "accurate" representation is in no way a prerequisite.  The very form and meaning of what we sense, is therefore decided according to some pre-existing interpretive framework, what Kant called the "synthetic a-priori", and furthermore, this interpretive framework is shaped by our very acts of striving, making it what Deleuze called an "active synthesis".</p>

	<h3>Problem 2: Convergence is Not a Guarantee</h3>

	<p>On its own, this is not necessarily an insurmountable obstacle.  Even if our observations are incomplete, or even "distorted" by bias, it's possible to narrow down possibilities and find counterevidence to our biases.  The key word here is "possible", it's possible insofar as there is the potential for <a href="../appendix/convergence.html">convergence</a>, a narrowing down that reliably reduces the range of possibiltiies without any chance in the long run of having to seriously backtrack.  Unfortunately, not everything works this way: financial markets, to take one example, have unpredictable wild swings that are so big they can wipe out decades of "reliable" gains; the same can be seen in a lot of "natural" phenomena as well.</p>

	<p>Of course, there are plenty of things we <i>can</i> converge on, or else we'd just be torn apart in a sea of chaos.  This question of convergence is in fact at the heart of the idea of how action and observation are linked: we are ultimately attempting to maintain enough of our own stability hat we can continue survive and proliferate: as such, we constantly work to converge on certain things like our body temperature, our pH levels, our internal organs under our skin, and so on.  This does not mean, however, that life is <i>only</i> about maintaining homeostasis: we are trajectories that are not simply at equilibrium, but we need <i>some</i> things to be in equilibrium in order to maintain our dynamism.</p>

	<p>As such, it is self-defeating to suppose that everything converges: our lives as individuals, families, societies, species, and ecologies are all processes, and processes are things that move rather than stay in a single place.  As such, there are deep scientific flaws to imagining that all inquiry is about revealing what's already been predetermined.</p>

	<h2>Reversing the Arrow</h2>

	<p>Given that observation is not something passive, that our "sensing" of anything is inseparable from how we <i>act</i>, which is in turn the origin of the a-priori judgment that tells us what a stimulus means, the most elementary "unit" of knowledge is not the observation, but the carrying out of an action.  All that matters for survival is to <i>do</i> what it takes to survive regardless of what you may "think" or "know" or "see".  But in practice it is clearly advantageous to see things in some way that is "truthful", lest a predator find a way to deceive you into becoming his next meal.</p>

	<p>Carrying out an action, however, is never an irreducible atomic unit.  Unlike a line of code, which either runs or does not, there is no instant "jump" (see Zeno's paradox); there is a continuity.  If I choose to swing my arm, I always begin the enactment but it might be cut off by some object that got in the way, or I might successfully carry it out to completion, and no matter what happens there is no way to rewind or pause what transpires.  Similarly, an enactment is something that might happen in multiple distinguishable parts, such as making a sandwich, which might necessitate going to the refrigerator or even going to the store to buy groceries.  This is not some pedantic detail: the fact that an enactment might involve any number of sub-tasks demonstrates the impracticality of breaking everything into sub-tasks: one never thinks in terms of some linear list of things they're going to do, there's always an overarching "goal" that other things shape themselves around.</p>

	<p>Much of this will be further elaborated on in the chapter on narrative, but for now what I want to say is that an enactment is not a single atomic event or a linear series of such events, but a trajectory that organizes itself around a conflict.  The "meaning" of something in this sense is intimately linked to how it fits into and changes the course of this trajectory.  An enactment can be something as large as a global war or as small as the perception of a small inert object, and it can be on the scale of a single cell or a vast civilization.  It may also contain smaller enactments, but it can never be fully decomposed lest the context of those smaller enactments be lost--as such, they are not the "building blocks" of the larger enactment but hills and valleys that further articulate the terrain of action.</p>

	<p>Sometimes these enactments can converge on a stable form, such as the example above with moving around to see that one is looking at a table rather than some other object.  This happens because one finds something <i>invariant</i> that doesn't change even as they act in different ways, and these invariances make up a <i>kerenel</i>.  Since this is something fundamentaly invariant to our <i>enactments</i> and not necessarily just to passive observations, it is absurd to assume that it is something that was sent to us from the heavens: without suggesting something as new age as to say that we "create" anything stability we observe, one must instead say that any "form" recognizable beyond a given corporeal instance is itself of Earth and not Heaven.</p>

	<p>Does this mean that our observations can't be trusted?  No!  It means the opposite: that we need not worry that our observations (in some grand sense of the term) are "illusions", because there is nothing veiled from, nothing beyond, our interactions with the material world.  Kernels may be refined or in some cases invalidated or even destroyed, but this is not from having been "wrong" all along but from progressing further along to the point where the complexity of our own endeavors has rendered earlier ideals obsolete.</p>
