	<h1>Hermeneutics and Decomposition</h1>

	<h2>Surface Crawling</h2>

	<p>A text has no interior.  No book, document, artwork, institution, or any other object contains content any more than Wittgenstein's box contains a beetle; "the medium is the message."  But there is a meaning to getting "inside" the text: to read a book is to bear witness a story that exists beyond patterns of letters on a page, to know a person is to intertwine oneself with the roads of their subjectivity.  At every step of the way, there's no door to unlock: one gets "inside" by traversing the surface one <a href="affordances_coevolution.html">affordance</a> at a time, simultaneously creating and navigating an invagination of the umwelt, the field of potential interactions between reader (actor) and text, composed of folds made from the twists and turns the reader's own path of enactments.</p>

	<p>While not containing anything, the text is nonetheless <i>porous</i>, enabling interiors that can be accessed by sufficiently diligent grazing along the surface.  Each such interior, coextensive with an active process of its "discovery" through skillful evaluation, with an act of <i>reading</i>, is the actualization of a latent potential between the reader and the text that both reveals and determines the "meaning" of the text, that is to say, nothing more and nothing less than the story being told.</p>

	<p>I say skillful because reading is indeed a skill: to be able to see affordances, to tell different stories by modulating the way in which one utilizes them.  Judmgent, rather than mere opinion or reaction, is the range of possible affections.  An affection, being a way in which one acts on a stimulus, is ultimately an <a href="enactments_kernels.html">enactment</a> on an affordance.  One therefore tells more nuanced stories, carves finer and more intricate paths along the umwelt by acting on a more developed judgmental faculty.  Hermeneutics is bricolage, neither of these defined as one single skill but as a kind of skill, a multiplicity of skills, and possibly the essence of skill in general insofar as one could define it as the actor's grasp of various matters.  Nor is it hierarchical: one does not fine tune one's mental negotiation with materials as a way to tell a "better" story, but as a way to have more stories to tell, more tools for navigating the psychic, social and epistemic tempests of life; to become not a better edge crawler but <i>more fully</i> an edge crawler.</p>
