	<h1>Hermeneutics & Feedback</h1>

	<i><p>"There are no facts, only interpretations."</p>

	<p>&mdash;Friedrich Nietzche</p></i>

	<p>To live, one must complete <a href="enactments_kernels">enactments</a>; in a fabled "state of nature" we must forage, build, defend ourselves, run away, and in the world we live in today the number of potential functions one may perform in order to survive is orders of magnitude higher.  What we do, rather than what we may or may not "think" of something, is what ultimately determines if and how we can get from point A to point B.  It therefore doesn't <i>necessarily</i> matter how truthful one's alleged beliefs are, but whether the actions they result in are helpful to the relevant enactment.</p>

	<p>This leaves a bunch of questions: why is this or that the relevant enactment?  Is this just a matter of survival, or can it be something else?  And where does a belief become action?  Is it even necessary for action in any meaningful sense of the term?</p>

	<h2>Feedback</h2>

	<p>While it might not answer every question, one way to begin unpacking this is to focus on something necessary even if not sufficient: whether or not "life" encompasses more than physical survival, the latter is a prerequisite for the former.  And in order to survive, there are certain things that must remain kept in some range, and one such thing is one's body temperature.  The body and mind alike must therefore work to regulate this dynamic.  Mammmals, being warm blooded, have bodies that by and large do this for them, but the effort to regulate doesn't stop there; should we feel too hot or too cold, we may put on or take off layers of clothing or go outside or stay inside.  We may in fact even create new inventions such as fans or air conditioners just to meet this goal of regulation.  This of course oversimplifies it, the air conditioner didn't just come from someone saying "I'm so hot I need to fix this", but the idea remains that in the quest to maintain homeostasis, any and all actions that could help are on the table.</p>

	<p>The paradigm of cybernetics describes this phenomenon as feedback: an entity will, when pushed outside of some desired state, take corrective action to return to that state.  This is specifically <i>negative feedback</i>, since it involves doing things that diminish the perturbation.  A thermostat may, for example, give turn on the heat when it gets too cold and turn it off once it gets hot enough, or maybe even turn on the air conditioner if it gets too hot.  Similar behaviors can also sometimes (but by no means always) be seen in markets: a rise in the demand or a drop in the supply of widgets may result in a rising price, which in turn may result in more people making more widgets because the increased price is an opportunity for profit, which may result in the supply going back up and the price subsequently going back down.</p>

	<p>Of course it's not just body temperature but a whole host of other processes that must remain stable for life to go on.  In many ways, one can think of running away from a predator as a type of feedback: in order to maintain the equilibrium of not being mauled to death, one must take the corrective action of escaping of neutralizing physical threats.  Of course, different threats may require different actions: sometimes it's so cold that your body alone can't keep you warm and so you need, if nothing else, gloves to prevent your fingers from getting frostbite.  Similarly, escaping or defeating someone who has a gun might require different skills and tactics than defending yourself against a hungry tiger.  One therefore requires, in order to survive, a sufficient variety of responses to address a variety of situations, a principle known as <i>Asbhy's Law of Requisite Variety</i>.</p>

	<p>And that in turn means that in order to preserve constancy, increasing variety is needed insofar as one must adapt to new potential threats to stability, and this creates a potential paradox unless one is able to define specific things that must remain constant as opposed to other things that should vary.  The preservation of equilibrium must therefore be seen as something that, outside of simple narrow systems such as thermostats, transpires in a <i>local</i> rather than a global sense.</p>

	<p>But local to what?  Another simple system may give a hint: the concept of negative feedback easily applies to the idea of guiding a missile to its target; as it veers further off course, some corrective mechanisms steers it back to where it's supposed to be.  But the goal is not to keep the missile alive indefinitely, it's just to make it detonate in the right place.  So in this case, the negative feedback is local with regards to the <i>action</i> of firing a missile at a target.</p>

	<p>So long as a system, such as a thermostat, continues to fulfill its function, its identity in any other sense of the word is irrelevant.  Similarly, more complex systems such as organisms perform actions in order to adapt to novel stressors and utilize negative feedback in order to make such actions possible; even something as simple as hunting requires neurological feedback to accurately aim a spear and the negative feedback of sweating to continually cool one's self off when chasing prey (a number of biological features, including the ability to sweat, give humans a gigantic advantage in endurance over many other animals, which allows hunting to be a process of wearing prey out before closing in.)  Negative feedback therefore matters for organisms insofar as it enables the actions that allow it to survive.</p>

	<p>But at the same time, any reasonable definition of being alive is more or less the extent to which something is able to do things: a corpse, no matter how well preserved, is simply not alive.  Therefore, in order to stay alive, an organism utilizes negative feedback not to maintain any kind of arbitrary fixed identity, but to maintain no more and no less than its own capacity for action; furthermore, it follows that this capacity for action isn't merely just something that helps it survive, but is the definition of any kind of "survival".</p>

	<p>And since the organism can and will continually change in any number of ways so long as this fundamental dynamism is preserved, an organism is not a fixed thing but itself a process; this in turn means that even an individual body may be willingly expended, since the dynamics of the process can continue on even if it's happening through a different substrate; that could mean a male angler fish willing to get killed and absorbed into its female counterpart or a parent giving their life to save their child.  Furthermore, or for that matter a person being willing to die for their home or even for an idea.</p>

	<p>This should not be seen as my saying that you get to literally live on as a subject through some copy: only that you may one day for whatever reason decide in your bones that there's something more important than your own physical self-preservation and that rather than being "irrational", this is simply the rationality of the process that defines you.  In any event, stability in itself cannot be seen as a basis for desire, but only as a supplement that gives cogency to the manifold actions that constitute the proliferation that characterizes life.</p>

	<h2>Traversal</h2>

	<p>In the local contexts where negative feedback reigns, the concept of interpretation is then relatively straightforward: a perturbation is corrected in order to maintain coherence.  There is no reason in this case to assume that there's any kind of "idea" in the loop beyond the action: a thermostat readjusts the temperature because there is a mechanism activated when the mercury in the thermometer drops either too high or too low, the price of a commodity (usually) stays very close to the cost to produce it because if the price is high enough the opportunity exists for somebody to sell at a lower price and make a profit and somebody somewhere will take that opportunity regardless of whether or not the average person is a "rational actor".</p>

	<p>In this case, interpretation is a question of what you <i>do</i>, since you ultimately always act on something regardless of whether or not there's any notion of internal deliberation involved and if you choose to act on something a specific way there must be some reason you acted on it one way and not the other.  Similarly, one can gab about how money is ultimately "imaginary" and not real, but how is this a more valid sign of what they "believe" about money than whether or not they use money in their everyday lives?  Even if you entertain the pretense that there exists an authentic belief someone has that is totally separate from anything they do, why not then assume that they're lying?  After all, if somebody said they hate strawberry ice cream and then later saw them eat a whole pint of it, you'd probably assume as much.</p>

	<h2>Surface Crawling</h2>

	<p>A text has no interior.  No book, document, artwork, institution, or any other object contains content any more than Wittgenstein's box contains a beetle; "the medium is the message."  But there is a meaning to getting "inside" the text: to read a book is to bear witness a story that exists beyond patterns of letters on a page, to know a person is to intertwine oneself with the roads of their subjectivity.  At every step of the way, there's no door to unlock: one gets "inside" by traversing the surface one <a href="affordances_coevolution.html">affordance</a> at a time, simultaneously creating and navigating an invagination of the umwelt, the field of potential interactions between reader (actor) and text, composed of folds made from the twists and turns the reader's own path of enactments.</p>

	<p>While not containing anything, the text is nonetheless <i>porous</i>, enabling interiors that can be accessed by sufficiently diligent grazing along the surface.  Each such interior, coextensive with an active process of its "discovery" through skillful evaluation, with an act of <i>reading</i>, is the actualization of a latent potential between the reader and the text that both reveals and determines the "meaning" of the text, that is to say, nothing more and nothing less than the story being told.</p>

	<p>I say skillful because reading is indeed a skill: to be able to see affordances, to tell different stories by modulating the way in which one utilizes them.  Judmgent, rather than mere opinion or reaction, is the range of possible affections.  An affection, being a way in which one acts on a stimulus, is ultimately an <a href="enactments_kernels.html">enactment</a> on an affordance.  One therefore tells more nuanced stories, carves finer and more intricate paths along the umwelt by acting on a more developed judgmental faculty.  Hermeneutics is bricolage, neither of these defined as one single skill but as a kind of skill, a multiplicity of skills, and possibly the essence of skill in general insofar as one could define it as the actor's grasp of various matters.  Nor is it hierarchical: one does not fine tune one's mental negotiation with materials as a way to tell a "better" story, but as a way to have more stories to tell, more tools for navigating the psychic, social and epistemic tempests of life; to become not a better edge crawler but <i>more fully</i> an edge crawler.</p>
