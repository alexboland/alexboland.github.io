	<h1>Kairos and Chronos</h1>

	<p>Chronos and Kairos are the two words for time used by the ancient Greeks, Chronos as a sequential passage from past to future, Kairos as the "opportune moment"--perhaps something as brief and fleeting as what we colloquially call a "moment" but perhaps also something as expansive as the right season to sow or the right reason to reap.  We've come to reduce time to only the former, dismissing the latter as a mere epiphenomenon fetishized by scientifically illiterate idealists, a notion regrettably reinforced by the naive denial of Einstein's rigorous confluence of space and time by many thinkers (though contrary to popular belief, not Bergson, whose qualms, justified or not, were about semantic ambiguities), but a pragmatic understanding of these concepts as two attributes by which we can understand time through different <i>topologies</i> with differing pragmatic, historical and technological bases can show why one should not treat these two conceptualizations of time as mutually exclusive.

	<h2>In the Beginning, There Was The Middle</h2>

	<p>I am not an anthropologist or a historian, and this is not supposed to be an accurate description of history.  This is a parable loosely based on a handful of reasonable approximations meant to demonstrate how our own ideas of time are at the root a matter of function:</p>

	<p>While there's always been some understanding of time as a linear passage from past to future, differences in material and social <a href="affordances_coevolution.html">affordances</a> dictate the actionable significance of seeing time this way.  Before the advent of writing and civilization, the scope of both history and the forseeable future must have been fundamentally limited: specific memories died with the passing away of those who held them, and that meant that with each generation that passed away, any record of that record could only be carried on through hearsay.  This of course has two serious limitations without the advent of writing: a tribe can only accumulate so much stored history because of limits to memory, and any memory passed on verbally would be inevitably distorted like a game of telephone.</p>

	<p>Being costly and fragile, any kind of memory passed down orally would exist insofar as it serves some kind of function, and to accomplish this feat would require passing down knowledge in a way that <a href="../appendix/convergence.html">converges</a> on something that maintains a kind of stability sufficent for such a function.  Such stability would require that there be some kind of <a href="../appendix/error_correcting_codes.html">error correcitng code</a>: a set of grammmatical rules could recognize and correct any sufficiently small distortion of the original message.  In the absence of writing, such a grammar would exist as a body of behavioral regularities and constraints actively learned and passed on through the repeated deliberate practice of ritual.  These rituals may nonetheless change in many ways, but so long as some <a href="enactments_kernels.html">kernel</a> that maintains is fucntionality is preserved, the ritual continues to live on as a single memory that is accessed and utilized in the same manner as the recall mechanisms of our own individual nervous systems.</p>

	<p>Even in the absence of the written word, however, humans have always been biologically capable of creating physical artifacts, and these too would play a role in ritual: a tribe could, for example, warn future generations of areas that are prone to infrequent but catastrophic events by providing physical markers whose tacit interpretation is preserved through inherited rituals built around them.  In both the case of oral tradition and such markers, however, there is a fundamental limitation: there are limits to how much one can memorize, and by extension limits on rituals.  The past, therefore, does not accumulate: it remains fixed and eternal and constitutes what we know today as <i>myth</i>.  Time, prior to certain fundamental technological breakthroughs, is cleaved into two areas: the eternal and unchanging past of myth, and a neighborhood of time around the present moment through which its living inhabitants travel.</p>

	<p>In the neighborhood of the present, there is an obvious passage of time: after all, pedants who angst about whether it's an illusion still make plans for the future.  But for somebody who actively lives time in a way where the past before their living ancestors exists only statically, any sequential idea of past and future exists only within a trajectory that spans only a few generations.  Any such idea of time as a linear and cumulative sequence of events is therefore only a <i>local</i> property of their own iteration of a larger <i>cycle</i>, and it is this cycle that lives on indefinitely.  This clevage between past and present-neighborhood applies not only to their own lifespan, but also in varying degrees to any number of cycles that exist at smaller scales: plans may be made for the immediate hunt, or the next cycle of animal migration, or the cold winter; in each case, memories exist in varying detail and with varying organizations to aid in the execution of the present <a href="enactments_kernels.html">enactment</a>, and they will just as quickly be forgotten unless they adopt some kind of relevance beyond the matter at hand and consequently become part of the skeleton of some encompassing <a href="narrative_data.html">narrative</a>.</p>

	<p>Every such narrative, and in fact every narrative, is a topology defined on time: a terrain that by and large, though never entirely, constrains and affords the ways in which events relate to one another.  Every topology on time has some kind of material and practical basis, whether that be the rhythm of a percussive instrument, the seasonal cycles of agriculture, the completion of a complex task, or the preservation of a ritual.</p>

	<p>Kairos is the concept of understanding time through such topologies, the "opportune moment" it denotes referring to the understanding of the present not as a single infinitesmal point but a neighborhood that defines one's power of action.  Chronos, by contrast, refers to an understanding of time not based in action and proximity but in linear order.  This concept of time, in the absence of the right technology, was deeply local and cursory; with the written word, that changed.  Writing was what allowed the past to be something not fixed but cumulative: as long as literacy was preserved through generations, an indefinite amount of past events could be stored and accessed at will, gradually transforming the past from mythology to history.</p>

	<p>More and more of time therefore became understandable as something strictly ordered and therefore a progression rather than mere cycles, but the idea of time as a totally ordered continuum of points required yet another technological revolution.</p>


	<h2>Constructing Chronos</h2>

	<p>Even with the advent of calendars and written history, most day to day operations still revolved around a present defined acting within the relevant moment: farmers got up at dawn and finished working at dusk.  Society was also, prior to the industrial revolution, almost entirely autarkic: markets were the icing on the cake, with most goods and tasks taken care of by the community with minimal specialization.  Working according to this kind of system, there was simply no need for there to be any real precision for time: as long as you got the day's work done the best you could, that was that.  Peasants might give a large chunk of their output to a lord who would make sure they're not being short-changed, but this did not necessitate any kind of fine-grained accounting for time.</p>

	<p>Calendars became gradually less sloppy through advances in astronomy that more precisely tracked and predicted celestial movements, and between this and other scientific advances the mechanical clock, precise under its own stored power, became a standard of time for scientists even if not for the average person.  The emergence of industry, however, created a type of work that required the maximization of profits through optimized efficiency and precise accounting, and while there were still limits to what could be done with this mode of production, its ubiquity was achieved through an exponentially growing positive feedback loop of standardization, urbanization, and profit sparked by the invention of the steam engine.  The more painstaking irreducible craftsmanship could be taken out of the equation by standardizing parts, the more could be rapidly produced through the raw energy of burning fossil fuels, the more factories could effortlessly outcompete artisinal goods, the more artisans flocked to the cities to work at factories in exchange for money that could buy these cheaper goods, the more industry could even further expand both its market and its operations.</p>

	<p>Currency had always existed before, but as it ate away at autarky it became the ultimate replaceable part.  The new way of working for an exponentially growing number of people was therefore no longer one based on loose approximations that work well enough, but on showing up at the exact minute work began and earning a precise amount of money for each minute worked.  The mechanical clock therefore became increasingly the way in which everyone related to time on a practical level.  The steam engine of course not only powered factories but also railroads, the means by which large amounts of goods and people could be transported across long distances.  The need to coordinate such transportation added yet another restriction to time: mechanical clocks alone are not enough, they must also be coordinated with each other; prior to this, each town might have its own chronological time that works well enough, but train schedules necessitated that every city belong to a specific time zone and base its time of day precisely on its time zone.</p>

	<p>This was the key challenge that led to the deep understanding of the relationship between time and space we have today.  Despite the best of efforts, perfectly synchronized clocks would inevitably fall subtly out of sync, creating barriers to how precisely anything could be coordinated.  The question of what went wrong was only solved when Einstein, in his theory of relativity, demonstrated that bodies move through time at varying speeds depending on their own spatial speed, an effect known as time dilation.  With this achievement, humanity's construction and understanding of Chronos was perfected.  At no point here should "construction" be misunderstood as a way of challenging the objectivity of Einstein's theory: relativity is objectively true insofar that it really does work in a way that is impossible to deny.</p>

	<h2>Not A Background, But A Geometry</h2>

	<p>The way in which the theory of relativity solved the problem of synchronization by accounting for time dilation is not just a mere tweak but a revolution in how one understands chronological time.  Any illusion that clocks may have engendered of time and space being passive backdrops against which change happens was completely abolished, instead affirming that there is always, no matter how small or subtle, a relationship between a body's motion and its own passage through time.</p>

	<p>In many ways, this abolishes any mechanistic notion of change: to try to understand how a system changes by mapping internal states to infinitesmal points on a one dimensional continuum might work as a good approximation for certain mechanistic phenomena, but even for a simple rock hurtling through the void of space it is not fundamentally true: instead, one's passage through time and space are faces of a single geometry from which neither can be cleanly separated.</p>

	<p>This does not, however, suggest that Chronos is the exclusively "true" way to conceptualize time: every topology on time is a material intersubjective substrate by which processes relate to change.  Chronos is not a topology on time so much as it is time conceptualized as a progression, with varying topologies being chronological to different degrees insofar that they unambiguously order events.  The theory of relativity, in turn, is a <a href="enactments_kernels.html">kernel</a> common to all topologies of time discovered through a process that took us from our relationship to the movements of the stars all the way to a a set of mathematical invariants, defined with regards to a constructed total ordering on events, that demonstrate the way in which change is not accidental but essential to time even when one strips away all possible confounding baggage.</p>

	<p>While the theory of relativity may only be articulated with a purely chronological vocabulary, it is nonetheless a kernel common to all understandings of time insofar that our purely chronological notion of time was itself a kernel distilled from a more variegated understanding of time (thus making it a kernel of a kernel, i.e. an even "deeper" kernel); it therefore sets immutable conditions on chronological time that would have to ultimately be respected by <i>any</i> topology of time.  To speak of something in terms of another topology is not to reject relativity or to speak of a merely "psychological" perception of time, but to highlight different ways in which different trajectories concretely relate to one another.</p>

	<p>Most chronological accounts of change are in fact mere mechanistic approximations of what we actually know about chronological time insofar that they by and large simply map a flat line of points on a continuum to a set of internal states as if time <i>were</i> in fact such a backdrop.  This approach is woefully inadequate for subjects like memory, biology, or history: processes in such domains are <a href="narrative_data.html">narratives</a>, understandable only through their own endogenous creation of context, its location with regards to the whole descernible only by inspecting its relationships with other events, and this information simply does not exist anywhere in a purely chronological timeline that extensionally maps points on a flat line to events that derive their significance from an intensional logic of juxtaposition.</p>

	<p>The geometric subtleties of relativity may yet tell us deep truths about these fundamentally intensional processes, but such a discovery would only emerge from bolstering our currently inadequate understanding of how such processes relate to change and discovering a (possibly deeper) kernel common to both this hypothetical approach and the known theory of relativity.  It is nonetheless mistaken to think that relativity does anything but endorse what was already evident from a less naively chronological understanding of time: that there is absolutely <i>nothing</i> metaphyiscal about it and that it always exists as a latent relationship between very real things.   Time is one ontology, Chronos and Kairos two different epistemologies that "cut it at the joints" in different ways and almost always work in tandem.</p>
