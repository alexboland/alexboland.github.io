	<h1>Kairos and Chronos</h1>

	<p>Chronos and Kairos are the two words for time used by the ancient Greeks, Chronos as a sequential passage from past to future, Kairos as the "opportune moment"--perhaps something as brief and fleeting as what we colloquially call a "moment" but perhaps also something as expansive as the right season to sow or the right reason to reap.  We've come to reduce time to only the former, dismissing the latter as a mere epiphenomenon fetishized by scientifically illiterate idealists, a notion further enforced by the debate between Einstein and Bergson in which Einstein famously stated that there is no time other than that of clocks and the subjective time of our experience.  The naive denial of Einstein's rigorous confluence of space and time by many thinkers, Bergson included, has made the idea of seeing time any other way the subject of derision, but a pragmatic understanding of these concepts as two different <i>topologies</i> on time with different pragmatic, historical and technological bases can show why one should not treat different conceptualizations of time as mutually exclusive.

	<h2>In the Beginning, There Was The Middle</h2>

	<p>I am not an anthropologist or a historian, and this is not supposed to be an accurate description of history.  This is a parable loosely based on a handful of reasonable approximations meant to demonstrate how our own ideas of time are at the root a matter of function:</p>

	<p>While there's always been some understanding of time as a linear passage, its importance and centrality at different points in history is up for debate.  Before the advent of writing and civilization, the scope of both history and the forseeable future must have been fundamentally limited: specific memories died with the passing away of those who held them, and that meant that with each generation that passed away, any record of that time was carried only in a second-hand form by the successor generation.  This could in theory go on forever, but given the inherent degradation that comes from a game of telephone (and this in addition to the way in which even the memories of one individual inevitably distort and decay), a great deal of specific knowledge would inevitably be lost.  Time, in this sense, is limited to an open neighborhood: an area with no one place where you can define the boundary but with an area beyond that lies outside of it.</p>

	<p>In practice, even the earliest hominids preserved some sense of the past through simple affordances--markers and rituals as texts that could preserve their meaning by having each generation teach its successor how you're supposed to interact with them: in other words, how to read them.  This kind of exceedingly basic grammar, while it cannot provide an indefinitely expanding timeline, still creates history in a more basic sense by creating a fixed and eternal backdrop beyond the open neighborhood of biological memory.</p>

	<p>But even within this defined neighborhood of direct biological generational memory, time is not strictly linear: memory is ultimatley built to aid in functionality and strengthens, weakens, and mutates based on usage: without the existence of a calendar or any reason to have anything like a calendar, all things of actionable significance would be based on the cycles of nature: day and night, seasons, menstruation, the human lifecycle, the migration and population patterns of predators and prey, etc.  Each iteration of such a cycle is itself a neighborhood: each one containing certain kinds of information that lose their relevance once you look beyond said neighborhood.</p>

	<p>Even in our own everyday lives, despite our addictions to clocks, there's no getting rid of kairos: when one engages in task they inhabit a neighborhood that is based around the trajectory of that <a href="enactments_kernels.html">enactment</a>--you cannot tell me what time you made the sandwich, it was a whole stretch of time, and you can't tell me the exact seconds that activity ended because there's no definable "boundary", instead it's smudgy.  The same goes for doijng so much as taking a single step while walking: neither your location nor the time you did it is precisely reducible to a single point on a line or a closed set containing that line.</p>

	<p>Kairos, while being about cycles, is called the opportune moment precisely because it's a question of the neighborhood you are in, and these neighborhoods can vary wildly in scale to encompass geological eons or near-instantaneous bodily movements.  We can speak of it vaguely in reference to the chronological time we know, but there's also no reason why kairos should be limited to being a <i>metric</i>, that is, something that shares the quasi-linear properties of Euclidean geometry: myths around which civilizations have defined the past are not necessarily grounded in the geometric constraints of the physical world, yet they too have a function that makes them part of their concept of time; kairos is ultimately a <i>non-metric</i> topology of time.</p>

	<h2>Constructing Chronos</h2>

	<p>Prior to the mechanical clock, work obeyed cycles: farmers got up at dawn and finished working at dusk.  Society was also, prior to the industrial revolution, almost entirely autarkic: markets were the icing on the cake, with most goods and tasks taken care of by the community with minimal specialization.  Working according to this kind of system, there was simply no need for there to be any real precision for time: as long as you got the day's work done the best you could, that was that.  Peasants might give a large chunk of their output to a lord who would make sure they're not being short-changed, but this did not necessitate any kind of fine-grained accounting for time.</p>

	<p>Then came the feedback loop of fossil fuel, industry, and urbanization.  The proliferation of inexpensive mass-produced goods with replacable parts mmade craftsmanship and autarky increasingly less viable: one had to move to the city and feed themselves by working at a factory for money.  Currency had always existed before, but now it had become the ultimate replaceable part.  Labor in the factory became more specialized and as such required both more rote repetition and more synchronization, making it both more possible and more important to regulate when people worked and quantify exact amounts of productive labor.  The workday did not start around sunrise, instead it started right at 7 AM, the workday being for all intents and purposes not an open neighborhood but instead a closed set of points in time with a definite beginning and end, each point having a precise amount of distance from another one.</p>

	<p>More or less siultaneously, the creation of continent-spanning railroads meant that transportation had to be strictly scheduled in order to synchronize trains, passengers, and cargo alike.  Although mechanical clocks had already been a part of many places, it was now important that they be used in a way that was synchronized to <i>one</i> time of day (with time zones to make up for some differences.)  Even with the most precise of technology, however, there were still inherent difficulties to keeping the clocks synchronized--they would inevitably differ despite the best of efforts to set them all to the right time, and this defied all intuitions about how time works.  It was only with Einstein's theories of relativity that this was solved by showing time and space to be related, and allowing for a new set of calculations that would account for the fact that time slows down for a body travelling at a faster speed.</p>

	<p>Whatever one thinks of the ontological status of chronological time, it is for our human and civilizational purposes a practical tool that allows us to synchronize actions on an enormous scale and stay "on the same page".  No animal uses it, and as individuals on an average day we only use it insofar that we need to (and rarely all that exactly): it exists only with regards to a technological solution to a problem that itself had subtle bugs until Einstein's scientific discovery perfected it.  Chronos is not time but a topology on time defined by truly real and impressive technological affordances of our own making, and relativity was the perfection of Chronos.</p>

	<h2>Two Ways of Seeing</h2>

	<p>Chronos works beautifully for the mechanistic: whether we're doing theoretical physics, scheduling trains, coordinating logistics, or tracking planetary movements, it gets the job done in a way that makes any other notion of time a laughable distraction in such endeavors.  For systems that do not readily map to any such mechanistic model, however, it simply doesn't speak the right language: one cannot define an exact time of an action when that action itself is a trajectory where its own beginning and end is something approximate (what is the moment in time that, say, a leap, begins?)  Truly complex processes are <a href="narrative_data.html">narratives</a>, understandable only through their own endogenous creation of context.  When one defines the time of an event in a narrative, it may in some cases be roughly definable in a chronological way, but its location with regards to the whole can only be understood by inspecting its relationships with other events, and this information simply does not exist anywhere in a purely chronological timeline that extensionally maps points on a flat line to events that derive their significance from an intensional logic of juxtaposition.</p>

	<p>Time is one ontology, Chronos and Kairos two different epistemologies that "cut it at the joints" in different ways.  Einstein and Bergson both failed to understand this.</p>
