	<h1>Affordances and Co-Evolution</h1>

	<p>"Meaning" is not found in any kind of extensional semantics, but in the intensional unfolding that comes from the utilization and creation of affordances.</p>

	<h2>Interpretation Through Action</h2>

	<p>An affordance is a material potential for <a href="enactments_kernels.html">enactment</a>, it does not strictly define what can be done but it does provide constraints.  An axe can be swung, a tree can be turned into wood, wood can be turned into paper, paper can be turned into a book, a book can be interpreted many different ways, and new interpretations may in turn be written down to create new vocabularies that allow new interpretations that were not before possible.</p>

	<p>"But isn't interpretation simply something between your ears?"  No, an interpretation is an action: it is the choice of how to utilize an affordance.  It's harder to see for something abstract like a piece of fiction or a philosophical text, but this too is every bit as "physical" in the final analysis: the true "meaning" of any "thought" is revealed by the actions that correspond to it, because those actions establish the <i>relationship</i> inputs and outputs between the subject and the world.  Even if it never escapes the play of soup and sparks between one's ears, it still manifests as those physical actions, their "semantics" coming from the relationship between the movements of the nervous system and the way that nervous system relates to the world.</p>

	<p>Because of this, a text, whether it be something "literally text" like a book, or the text in the larger sense that I mean it (see <a href="../ingress.html">Ingress</a>), is never a naive exegesis of some unsubstantiated mental activity--it is itself an interpretation of one's own mental activity, a utilization of one's own relationships with the world to <i>create</i> new text.</p>

	<h2>Co-Evolution Writes The Text</h2>

	<p>The creation of new text is itself the creation of new affordances.  This process, by which existing affordances are utilized to create new ones, is co-evolution.  In the colloquial sense, one can see it in the way that a beaver can create a dam only because trees exist or in the way that there can be no carnivores if no other animals exist; every act begets new potential.  One can also see this in the way markets work.  More importantly, all discourse relies on co-evolution: the writing of new text is the creation of new ideas because a word, a sentence, a paragraph, or a whole book can mean many things to many different people because they can apply ideas differently, see different connotations based on their own experience, connect the words to other words that others hadn't seen.</p>

	<p>It's not enough to say that this is why aesthetics is important; it's why "meaning" is aesthetics all the way down.</p>
