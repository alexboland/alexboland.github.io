<h2>Ecocide (October 2018)</h2>
 
<p>Ecocide is the destruction of information.</p>

<p>You can reforest an area, but you can't restore the ecological nuances that have been erased any more than you can burn a book and replace it with randomly generated words.</p>

<p>Ecologies can't be revived, only rewritten.</p>
