<h2>Archiving (February 2019)</h2>
 
<p>The opposite of remembering isn't forgetting, it's data.</p>

<hr />

<p>True memory is the enrichment of intuition.</p>

<p>Naive formulations of "archiving", divorced from viscerality and community, are ineffectual facsimiles, not even ghosts but mere pollution. To compulsively "remember" through excessive data is worse than forgetting.</p>

<p>A true archive is one that enriches the collective intuition of its surrounding ecology.</p>
