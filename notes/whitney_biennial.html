<h2>Epistemology for the End of the World: Whitney Biennial Edition (September 2019)</h2>
 
<p>It finally hit me what bothers me so much about the vast majority of contemporary art. It was just a matter of putting together what I already concluded earlier:</p>

<p>A work of art is meaningful insofar as it is effective, and it is effective in so far as it fulfills its role as a process of play that unlocks new affordances from which more play arises. In other words, Art, in the global/structural sense of the word, is in many ways a process of compound interest where the enabling of more art is equivalent to reinvestment and any contribution it makes to something like philosophy or science is equivalent to pocketing dividends.</p>

<hr />

<p>Now before you accuse me of getting all neoliberal, this is a very loose metaphor! Whereas the compounding appreciation of money is a convergent process, art is inherently divergent and involves an ever accelerating differentiation into forking paths.</p>

<p>Even this is a loose metaphor, as the very efficacy of art comes from the infinitely nuanced topology that defines its material and social logic. But I digress: the problem I have with the state of contemporary art is that the vast majority of it feels like a dead end, ossified detritus that can't be built on, land that simply isn't arable.</p>

<hr />

<p>And in general I don't blame artists: this is a natural consequence of the current economic configuration, in which things are by and large a zero-sum game where the rules of the game are to seek out easily taxonomizable trends and make a go-for-broke attempt at glory instead of organically integrating one's practice into a greater discursive/technical milieu.</p>

<p>More to the point, this lackluster state of aesthetics is a direct material symptom of rent-seeking and the hyperterritorialization that necessarily enables and accompanies it.  One can even note a strange structural similarity to our current ecological crisis.</p>

<p>This is amazon.com, bitches.</p>
