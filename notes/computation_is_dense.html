<h2>Computation is Dense</h2>
 
<p>Computation is dense in the Real</p>

<p>For any given phenomena, you can find an arbitrarily close simulation, just like you can find an arbitrary close fraction with regards to any real number.</p>

<p>But organic matter, being the real thing, always has crevices to slip through. Fractions are still different from irrational numbers and the same goes for computation.</p>
