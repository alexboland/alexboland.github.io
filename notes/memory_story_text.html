<h2>Memory, Story, Text (October 2018)</h2>
 
<p>Memory is lazy.</p>

<p>A memory exists as a potential that is only actualized upon an act of evaluation, that is, upon the telling of a story.</p>

<p>A story is always an act, a memory always the potential for such an act; a text is a medium through which memory is actualized.</p>

<p>A story is expressed through the evaluation of a text, but a text is not a stimulus; rather it's a prism that refracts memory into stories.</p>

<p>Storytelling is inherently contingent, the writing of a new text.</p>
