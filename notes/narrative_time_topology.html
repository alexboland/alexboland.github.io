<h2>Narrative, Time, Topology (July 2020)</h2>
 
<p>Every narrative is a topology on time.</p>

<p>Every topology on time has a material and practical basis, whether that basis is the rhythm of a percussive instrument, the seasonal cycles of agriculture, the preservation of adaptive knowledge through ritual, or the physical pages of a chronicle.</p>

<p>Chronological time is a topology that bypasses and supplements but does not fully replace narrative topologies, materially constructed from the perfection of the mechanical clock.  The relativistic fabric of spacetime is truly Objective insofar that it is the basis for completely synchronizing clocks, but it does not and cannot fully reduce every other material intersubjective substrate by which we relate to motion.</p>
