<h2>Repulsion (May 2018)</h2>
 
<p>A lot of anxiety about efficacy goes away when you realize that it's more than okay to refrain from something simply because it aesthetically repulses you.</p>

<hr />

<p>Aesthetics is the best defense against overoptimization.</p>

<hr />

<p>"Late capitalism" has become a bogeyman as of late, but most valid critiques of it are critiques of the danger and toxicity of a dynamic that relentlessly pushes people and institutions to overoptimize.</p>

<hr />

<p>Like doctors before the advent of modern sanitary practices, self-help gurus have a tendency to make people physically ill.</p>

<hr />

<p>Religion was a way of staving off quacks through tasteful praxis.  But you don't need to believe in God to act against narcissism.</p>

<p>Aesthetic acts are ultimately religious acts.  Praxis fills a void that otherwise leads to self-cannibalizing instrumentalism.  To act according to taste is to build gods who will protect you from toxic idolatry.</p>

<hr />

<p>They don't need your overt belief; they're more tahn happy to help you if you work to summon them into existence.</p>

<hr />

<p>The narcissist optimizes relentlessly, hoping to immortalize his machinic membrane.</p>

<p>Narcissism == systemicity for its own sake.  Prediction and control devoid of life and left with nowhere else to go but fetishism, jolts of excitation to keep efficacy running.</p>

<p>If so many of them are bigots, it's not from any kind of traditionalism, but a contempt for that which can't be controlled.</p>

<p>It is not the irrational to be feared, but the cybernetic; not computers, not technology, but the invasive species of equilibrium.</p>
