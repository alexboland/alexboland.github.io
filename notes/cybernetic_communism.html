<h2>The Problem With "Cybernetic Communism" (November 2020)</h2>
 
<p>"Cybernetic communism" is a gigatnic oxymoron.  The point of communism is that class consciousness becomes the new constitution of the economy rather than the exploitation of price differentials (which are already a cybernetic concept when conceptualized in terms of classic [equilibrium-based] economics.)  In other words, a communist revolution must be a fundamentally unforeseeable shift in social ontology.</p>

<p>Not even sure if I buy into the idea, but that's what it is: a conceptual revolution that permeates all the way to the flesh.  Don't get it twisted with this more-rational-than-though command economics claptrap.</p>
