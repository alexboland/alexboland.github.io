<h2>Spinoza & Intuitionism (January 2021)</h2>
 
<p>Spinoza's mistaken elimination of contingency is a reflection of assuming the law of the excluded middle and a backdrop of already-granted univocity.  A re-reading of Spinoza with the use of intuitionist logic would not only get rid of the refutation of any kind of free will, but in fact definitively demonstrate such Free Will in the strongest possible sense.</p>
