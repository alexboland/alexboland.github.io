<h2>Against Consequentialism (January 2019)</h2>
 
<p>Consequentialism is a front for evil.  Every example ever relies on a model, <i>not</i> the real world, so you can slip in any assumptions to justify whatever you want.</p>

<p>Every ethical decision has a texture that's inseparable from our instincts and their significance within a larger ecology, a dimensionality not capturable by "utility" (which is only an axiom enfocing transitivity within a model, <i>not</i> some a-priori idea of "value".)</p>

<p>Good is the proliferation of life.  To ignore instinct is to ignore information embedded in life that helped it proliferate.</p>

<hr />

<p>Before anyone takes me out of context, this is not an injunction against the application of reason, it's a warning not to limit the application of reason to a tinkertoy approximation of reality.</p>
