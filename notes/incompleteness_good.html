<h2>Incompleteness Is A Good Thing! (February 2021)</h2>
 
<p>Everyone is always despairing about Godel's theorems but they're actually important and good: tehy're what makes science possible.  To do science experiments you need a rigorous language for defining exactly hwat you're looking for, but you need propositions that aren't mere tautologies.</p>

<hr />

<p>The need to introduce new axioms in order to syntactically arrive at certain propositions is what allows one to shape the evolution of a theory by creating an empirical basis for whther or not a syntactically unreachable proposition is "true" or not.</p>

<hr />

<p>Experiments are used to settle those undecidable propositions, which allows them to have a rigorous definition in relation to the paradigm while directly shaping theoretical developments instead of just being trivially coextensive with what the theory implies</p>
