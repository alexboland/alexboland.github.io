<h2>Teology Is A Tool (September 2020)</h2>
 
<p>Teleology is a tool and a method, not necessarily a categorical statement about reality.  Removing final cause from all philosophical reasoning leads to mechanistic chauvinism that impedes science and ethics alike by ignoring how systems can define a trajectory through developing their own logical closures.</p>

<p>Such nihilism also leads to utilitarianism, in which all narrative is conceived of as an irrational impediment to some kind of ostensible optimization.</p>
