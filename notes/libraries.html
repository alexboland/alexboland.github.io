<h2>Libraries (May 2018)</h2>
 
<p>The difference between a library and a reading list is that a reading list neurotically keeps some kind of arbitrary score and turns exploration and serendipity into a spectator sport.</p>

<p>A library by contrast gives you options and affordances, a garden of potential paths that doesn't arbitrarily cut things up into whole books or limit things to a single reader.</p>
