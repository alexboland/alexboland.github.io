	<p>is there any more insidious form of trying to drag people down as offhandedly putting down things they enjoy?  downplaying play is a much more direct attack on the conatus than downplaying accomplishments.</p>

	<p>People vastly underestimate the inherent toil of science; it's heavy-duty construction, not "bayesian" LARPing or simple "trial and error".</p>

	<p>at some point I'll get sick of mathematics and move on to philosophy, which I'll then get sick of and move on to prose, at which point I'll be doing actual geometry for once in my life.</p>
	<p>but if I don't deliberately exhaust myself in htis fashion it'll just be sophistry.</p>

<div>
	<p>Yeah everything is arguably "of your mind" in some sense, but your mind isn't an arbitrary theater of representations, it's a nexus of affordances.  Patterns are at least as "real" as the relations between things that allow a "self" to be constituted and for such a self to conceptualize them in the first place.</p>

<div>
	<p>Process and data are isomporhic only when dealing with countable sets. Otherwise, becoming is always too big to fit into identity.</p>

<div>
	<p>Process rather than organism is the basic "unit" of life. Looking at the object first misses the information that only "exists" in a temporal context.</p>

	<p>Resolve is real, you're not just some cybernetic system bumbling into equilibrium.</p>

	<p>When you explicitly define terms you're building a machine, when you're choosing words based on a sense of hermeneutic continuity you're further articulating an ecology.</p>

<div>
	<p>Aesthetics is the part of the horseshoe where pragmatism becomes idealism and vice versa.</p>
	<p>Art is the lived ideal of pragmatism for its own sake; the singularities through which we relentlessly find novel paths out of an inexorably multiplying wilderness.</p>

<div>
	<p>The great equalizer is that no matter how much sense your argument makes and no matter how much someone else doesn't know what they're talking about, they can still pander to their acolytes by calling you a pee pee poo poo face.</p>
	<p>On some level that's genuinely beautiful.</p>

<div>
	<p>Wittgenstein's latter philosophy is about duck-typing and how if you're classifying things any other way you're constipating yourself.</p>
	<p>Word-play, rather than trying to make a "logical" system from the top-down, is how you make language more logical.</p>

	<p>Theorems are instantiated and maintained by practice, without practice they're at most inscrutable markings on paper.</p>

<div>
	<p>Psychologizing people is the absolute lowest form of epistemology.  It's not even a fallacy, it's diving to the bottom of the discursive bargain bin.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p>If you want to help your neighbors and peers, diligently build up your own foundations such that you have the power to do so.  Refusing to try to improve yourself amounts to planning to be unable to help others in any way.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p>When I believe somebody's narrative about themselves, it has absolutely nothing to do with wondering whether that's the objective truth, it's simply me choosing to do so.</p>

	<p>Texts are discrete but narratives are geometric.  This is the circle one has to square between computation and process.</p>

<div>
	<p>Probability theory is a money pump and using it for any other kind of epistemology is iffy (but sometimes understandable.)</p>

	<p>I'm convinced that the difference between Plato and Heraclitus is whether or not to invoke the law of the excluded middle.</p>

<div>
	<p>Mao had no idea what the fuck dialectics are, I don't care what he wrote.  If you exterminate a whole species without considering their co-evolutionary links, you don't grasp even teh most basic idea of how information exists as point and counterpoint.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">January 12, 2021</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>The difference between a theory and a model is that a theory is a haeccity that speaks for itself in a way that has nothing to do with the idea of a model "corresponding" with an ostensibly underlying reality.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">January 11, 2021</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>A lot of things become more aesthetic when you think about them as terrain:</p>
	<p>aesthetics = affordances</p>
	<p>This is exactly what bores me about so much contemporary art: I want avenues and possibilities, not soft-spoken "commentary".</p>

	<p>"Isomorphic" means "the same for all intents and purposes", where intents are inbound morphisms and purposes are outbound morphisms.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">December 26, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Every text is a contract that we fulfill in our own way whenever we perform it.  A disagreement about interpretation is not a disagreement about some internal "meaning" but a quarrel about whether or not both sides are satisfactorily holding up their end of the bargain.</p>
	<p>There is something to hermeneutics beyond this interminable interfacing, but it does not belong to the public-facing part of it.  The irreducible heraclitean flux that differentiates each specific act of reading is not semantic but spiritual.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">December 18, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Semantics isn't "meaning" (pragmatics already has that covered), it's the possibility of lying.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">December 17, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>The difference between a theory and a model is that a theory is a language.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">December 15, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>The whole debate about gut feelings vs. formal reasoning mistakenly conflates everything into an idea of solving a defined problem.  Emotions are not propositions, their purpose is not positive knowledge but tacit ecological calibration.  They're an interface, not a forecaster.</p>

	<p class="aphorism_date">December 11, 2020</p>

<div>
	<p>A lot of the bad mental parts of aging are more of a choice than people think.  As long as one has the will to embrace catabolism there's so much you can do.  Do things that burn your pretenses to ashes no matter how uncomfortable and you'll live much longer.</p>

<div>
	<p>Art for its own sake, even (especially) in the face of imminent danger, is the ultimate expression of refusing to let the enemy dictate (and by extension predict) your next move.</p>

	<p>No matter how hurtfully someone berates you, always take pleasure in the fact that you can continue to live your truth as much as you want and there isn't a damn thing they can do about it.</p>

<div>
	<p>Low self-esteem is an <i>uncalibrated</i> idea of one's own social functioning.  One's ego can still be in many respects overblown and this is perfectly consistent with it: unmoored from any truly foundational sense of efficacy, one vascillates between extreme hope and fear about their own disembodied pretense of status.</p>

<div>
	<p>"Hi, I'm set theory.  This set has the letters a and b.  This set has the numbers zebra and paddington.  These sets are different because they correspond to different things.  What do you mean where are the things?? Stop being a smartass they OBVIOUSLY correspond to distinct concepts!"</p>

<div>
	<p>Our emotions are based on the precise material "fit" between organism and environment.  They're not magical or predictive in any transcendent way but they're the least refined yet highest-bandwidth information channel possible.</p>

<div>
	<p>Even when you're not using your smartphone, you're already trained to ruminate instead of look.  And eventually the less you look the less you actually think.</p>
	<p>It's nice out today (at least it was when I wrote this).  Go outside, find a big open space, turn off your phone for a few minutes and just look.

<div>
	<p>Even back wen I was young enough to care about "getting around" or whatever, I never understood this idea of Hugh Hefner being the "luckiest man alive".  He always sounded like the equivalent of some animal locked in a zoo coerced into breeding for other people's amusement.</p>

	<p>Liquidity (capital) is the discrete topology on society.  Any region you can identify is precisely closed off and separable from everything else.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">November 12, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Just like a foldable data type in Haskell is not necessarily any kind of predefined container, but rather a set of functions of expansion or contraction, foldings and unfoldings in life are acts of manifestation that exist in their own right independently of any extant vessel.</p>

	<p class="aphorism_date">November 12, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Philosophical concepts are open neighborhoods, and mathematical/logical concepts follow as closure complements.</p>
	<p>By open neighborhoods, I mean that they're simply plopped down a-priori, you declare the concepts and any "meaning" can only follow from the ensuing topology.</p>

	<p>Web development is the distilled pure essence of neoliberalism.  Relentlessly growing layers of abstraction in the hopes of perfect interoperability.</p>

	<p class="aphorism_date">November 10, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Narrative is the visceral topology by which language games can be played and words can be contextualized.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">November 10, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>I'm willing to call philosophy science if and only if science is once again understood to be an irreducible act of disciplined reflection rather than ritualistic magic.</p>

	<p class="aphorism_date">November 2, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Sufficiently small things can be bounded into being predictable, sufficiently big things move slow enough to be predictable, but evrything in between cannot be predicted, only harmonized with.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">October 31, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Wittgenstein understood that philosophy is, like every toher craft, something you have to learn to do with a light touch and free of redundant movements.  Bad philosophy comes from people's pretenses sticking to their ideas like toilet paper to a shoe (and has that same stink.)</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">October 29, 2020</p>

<div>
	<p>Non-determinism is a computational concept, not an ontological one.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">October 29, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>There are two kinds of confidence: the kind where your expectations inflate, and the kind where you simply feel more calibrated regardless of expectations.  I'll leave it to you to decide which one is good and which one isn't.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">October 24, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Consumerism perverts the very idea of "hope" by training us to hold our breath for one meaningless possibility or reward after another until we've developed a submissive relationship with every waking hour of the day.  This is much different than a deep sense of striving.</p>
	<p>Desire qua "lack" is obviously a timeless fact of life, but it's possible to either exacerbate or diminish its prevalence depending on your habits.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">October 23, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>The only actual difference between science and philosophy is that science converges and philosophy diverges.  Lately we've exhausted a lot of low-hanging fruit and philosophy will make a comeback as a way of balkanizing and tailoring epistemology with science and first among equals.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">October 22, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Mind over matter is real, it's just not cartesian volition.  Your mind is how the parts are put together in a way that exceeds their material contingency.  That you can amke a turing machine out of all kinds of different materials is a prime (but not exhaustive) example.</p>
	<p>But it also means that it's not a question of "will" but of development; it takes time and there are no shortcuts.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p>The reason why there are so many conflicting anecdotes about this or that magical diet or life hack or whatever finally doing the trick and fixing somebody's problem (and why this kind of reductive advice rarely works) is that the raw materials matter infinitely less than how you put them together; something that can only be learned through experience and painstaking creativity.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p>The core mistake that defines scientism is believing that one starts at the finest possible level of granularity and derives larger patterns from the interactions.</p>
	<p>All inquiry starts in the middle, from which one both distills parts and composes wholes.</p>

<div>
	<p>"What is it like to be a bat?" is doubly bad cartesianism.  You're not merely suggesting taking a homunculus out of your body and putting it in someone else's, you're suggesting taking a homunculous out of that homunculus and putting it in the other homunculus.</p>

	<p>Truly great art engenders the syntax of a new space.  To try to find a direct "message" in any such thing would be like trying to explain why this or that mathematical axiom is "true".</p>
