	<p>is there any more insidious form of trying to drag people down as offhandedly putting down things they enjoy?  downplaying play is a much more direct attack on the conatus than downplaying accomplishments.</p>

	<p>at some point I'll get sick of mathematics and move on to philosophy, which I'll then get sick of and move on to prose, at which point I'll be doing actual geometry for once in my life.</p>

	<p>Yeah everything is arguably "of your mind" in some sense, but your mind isn't an arbitrary theater of representations, it's a nexus of affordances.  Patterns are at least as "real" as the relations between things that allow a "self" to be constituted and for such a self to conceptualize them in the first place.</p>

	<p>Process and data are isomporhic only when dealing with countable sets. Otherwise, becoming is always too big to fit into identity.</p>

	<p>Process rather than organism is the basic "unit" of life. Looking at the object first misses the information that only "exists" in a temporal context.</p>

	<p>Aesthetics is the part of the horseshoe where pragmatism becomes idealism and vice versa.</p>

	<p>The great equalizer is that no matter how much sense your argument makes and no matter how much someone else doesn't know what they're talking about, they can still pander to their acolytes by calling you a pee pee poo poo face.</p>

	<p>Wittgenstein's latter philosophy is about duck-typing and how if you're classifying things any other way you're constipating yourself.</p>
	<p>Word-play, rather than trying to make a "logical" system from the top-down, is how you make language more logical.</p>

	<p>Psychologizing people is the absolute lowest form of epistemology.  It's not even a fallacy, it's diving to the bottom of the discursive bargain bin.</p>

	<p>If you want to help your neighbors and peers, diligently build up your own foundations such that you have the power to do so.  Refusing to try to improve yourself amounts to planning to be unable to help others in any way.</p>

	<p>When I believe somebody's narrative about themselves, it has absolutely nothing to do with wondering whether that's the objective truth, it's simply me choosing to do so.</p>

	<p>Mao had no idea what the fuck dialectics are, I don't care what he wrote.  If you exterminate a whole species without considering their co-evolutionary links, you don't grasp even teh most basic idea of how information exists as point and counterpoint.</p>

<div>
	<p>The difference between a theory and a model is that a theory is a haeccity that speaks for itself in a way that has nothing to do with the idea of a model "corresponding" with an ostensibly underlying reality.</p>

	<p>A lot of things become more aesthetic when you think about them as terrain:</p>
	<p>aesthetics = affordances</p>
	<p>This is exactly what bores me about so much contemporary art: I want avenues and possibilities, not soft-spoken "commentary".</p>

<div>
	<p>Every text is a contract that we fulfill in our own way whenever we perform it.  A disagreement about interpretation is not a disagreement about some internal "meaning" but a quarrel about whether or not both sides are satisfactorily holding up their end of the bargain.</p>
	<p>There is something to hermeneutics beyond this interminable interfacing, but it does not belong to the public-facing part of it.  The irreducible heraclitean flux that differentiates each specific act of reading is not semantic but spiritual.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">December 18, 2020</p>

<div>
	<p>Semantics isn't "meaning" (pragmatics already has that covered), it's the possibility of lying.</p>

<div>
	<p>The difference between a theory and a model is that a theory is a language.</p>

<div>
	<p>The whole debate about gut feelings vs. formal reasoning mistakenly conflates everything into an idea of solving a defined problem.  Emotions are not propositions, their purpose is not positive knowledge but tacit ecological calibration.  They're an interface, not a forecaster.</p>

	<p>A lot of the bad mental parts of aging are more of a choice than people think.  As long as one has the will to embrace catabolism there's so much you can do.  Do things that burn your pretenses to ashes no matter how uncomfortable and you'll live much longer.</p>

	<p>Low self-esteem is an <i>uncalibrated</i> idea of one's own social functioning.  One's ego can still be in many respects overblown and this is perfectly consistent with it: unmoored from any truly foundational sense of efficacy, one vascillates between extreme hope and fear about their own disembodied pretense of status.</p>

	<p>"Hi, I'm set theory.  This set has the letters a and b.  This set has the numbers zebra and paddington.  These sets are different because they correspond to different things.  What do you mean where are the things?? Stop being a smartass they OBVIOUSLY correspond to distinct concepts!"</p>

	<p>Our emotions are based on the precise material "fit" between organism and environment.  They're not magical or predictive in any transcendent way but they're the least refined yet highest-bandwidth information channel possible.</p>

	<p>Even when you're not using your smartphone, you're already trained to ruminate instead of look.  And eventually the less you look the less you actually think.</p>
	<p>It's nice out today (at least it was when I wrote this).  Go outside, find a big open space, turn off your phone for a few minutes and just look.

	<p>Even back wen I was young enough to care about "getting around" or whatever, I never understood this idea of Hugh Hefner being the "luckiest man alive".  He always sounded like the equivalent of some animal locked in a zoo coerced into breeding for other people's amusement.</p>

	<p>Liquidity (capital) is the discrete topology on society.  Any region you can identify is precisely closed off and separable from everything else.</p>

<div>
	<p>Just like a foldable data type in Haskell is not necessarily any kind of predefined container, but rather a set of functions of expansion or contraction, foldings and unfoldings in life are acts of manifestation that exist in their own right independently of any extant vessel.</p>

<div>
	<p>Philosophical concepts are open neighborhoods, and mathematical/logical concepts follow as closure complements.</p>
	<p>By open neighborhoods, I mean that they're simply plopped down a-priori, you declare the concepts and any "meaning" can only follow from the ensuing topology.</p>

	<p>I'm willing to call philosophy science if and only if science is once again understood to be an irreducible act of disciplined reflection rather than ritualistic magic.</p>

	<p>Sufficiently small things can be bounded into being predictable, sufficiently big things move slow enough to be predictable, but evrything in between cannot be predicted, only harmonized with.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p>Wittgenstein understood that philosophy is, like every toher craft, something you have to learn to do with a light touch and free of redundant movements.  Bad philosophy comes from people's pretenses sticking to their ideas like toilet paper to a shoe (and has that same stink.)</p>
	<hr />

<div>
	<p>There are two kinds of confidence: the kind where your expectations inflate, and the kind where you simply feel more calibrated regardless of expectations.  I'll leave it to you to decide which one is good and which one isn't.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">October 24, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>Consumerism perverts the very idea of "hope" by training us to hold our breath for one meaningless possibility or reward after another until we've developed a submissive relationship with every waking hour of the day.  This is much different than a deep sense of striving.</p>
	<p>Desire qua "lack" is obviously a timeless fact of life, but it's possible to either exacerbate or diminish its prevalence depending on your habits.</p>
	<hr />
	<p class="aphorism_date">October 23, 2020</p>
</div>

<div>
	<p>The only actual difference between science and philosophy is that science converges and philosophy diverges.  Lately we've exhausted a lot of low-hanging fruit and philosophy will make a comeback as a way of balkanizing and tailoring epistemology with science and first among equals.</p>

</div>

<div>
	<p>Mind over matter is real, it's just not cartesian volition.  Your mind is how the parts are put together in a way that exceeds their material contingency.  That you can amke a turing machine out of all kinds of different materials is a prime (but not exhaustive) example.</p>
	<p>But it also means that it's not a question of "will" but of development; it takes time and there are no shortcuts.</p>

<div>
	<p>The reason why there are so many conflicting anecdotes about this or that magical diet or life hack or whatever finally doing the trick and fixing somebody's problem (and why this kind of reductive advice rarely works) is that the raw materials matter infinitely less than how you put them together; something that can only be learned through experience and painstaking creativity.</p>

<div>
	<p>The core mistake that defines scientism is believing that one starts at the finest possible level of granularity and derives larger patterns from the interactions.</p>

	<p>"What is it like to be a bat?" is doubly bad cartesianism.  You're not merely suggesting taking a homunculus out of your body and putting it in someone else's, you're suggesting taking a homunculous out of that homunculus and putting it in the other homunculus.</p>

	<p>Truly great art engenders the syntax of a new space.  To try to find a direct "message" in any such thing would be like trying to explain why this or that mathematical axiom is "true".</p>

	<p>Rationality is nothing more than doing the hard work of investigation.  That's it.

	<p>If you think there's no seeing past Cartesian "representations", that implies that "your" subjectivity is in no way defined by the patterns that you're part of but not the entirety of.</p>
	<p>In other words, you've just decided by fiat that other people don't exist because you chose to value glib axioms over other people's existence.  This is not epistemology, it's ideology.</p>

	<p>Aesthetics is raw intuition: generating an "idea" that does not have the connections to other signs to make it formally definable, and as such manifests as irreducible physical action.</p>
	<p>What makes this different from mere emotion/passion is that while it might be provoked by something (like some beautiful sight), it's fundamentally an <i>action</i> rather than a passive <i>reaction</i>.</p>
	<p>This applies both to privately having some beautiful experience and performing/making something that others can witness.  Both are performance as opposed to mere signal transmission.</p>

	<p>The hardware/software distincion outside of actual computers is always nebulous and often meaningless, but the best way to view it is that software is that which remains invariant between actors.  A text may offer us each different affordances ("meanings"), but there is, in most cases, a common kernel that allows us to relate to one another through it.</p>
	<p>This is not some a-priori "object" but an invariant that for whatever reason holds amongst the tangle of interactions.</p>
	<p>The best example of such a thing I can think of right now is currency.  We may value things differently, and even have different ideas of what "value" even is, but money is a common interface through which our acts of valuation operate.</p>
