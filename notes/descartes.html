<h2>Descartes Before The Horse (February 2021)</h2>
 
<p>The issue isn't whether or not there's an "objective" reality behind your representation of it, it's that all of your "representations" are byproducts of your interactions with the world in the first place, so you're already putting Descartes before the horse.</p>

<p>In fact, not everything subjective is necessarily a representation because in order for that to be the case there has to be enough causal separation between yourself and the outside world for you to contain something fundamentally detached from what's outside your skull.</p>
