<h2>Initial Conditions & "Meta-Stability" (March 2021)</h2>
 
<p>That your model can be dead wrong due to small differences in initial conditions (ðŸ¦‹ effect) doesn't tell you that small differences in initial conditions are insurmountable, it just tells you that your model might fail to capture how things in the real world self-regulate.</p>

<p>In fact, it assumes that the stability of what you're studying would be expressed with the same vocabulary as your variables.  Nerds mistakenly call this "meta-stability"; there's nothing "meta" about it you nincompoop, it's just that what persists isn't captured by your language!</p>
