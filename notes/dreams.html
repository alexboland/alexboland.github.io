<h2>Rough Theory of Dreams (April 2019)</h2>
 
<p>Our actions in everyday life are progressions of narratives, one action leading to another, progressing however they can.</p>

<p>The information that determines our actions is hugely grounded in constant physical constraints that surround us.</p>

<p>When asleep, we are still to an extent mentally active, and in fact acting in a way that clears up our minds</p>

<p>To clear something from one's mind is to clear the backed up stack of planned actions and close the narrative. When you finish a task you free up capacity.</p>

<p>When dreaming, however, the physical grounding disappears. What we retain is the invariant structure, unmoored from physical constraints we otherwise rely on.</p>

<p>As a result, we carry out something effectively isomorphic to what it would be in the waking world, thus the existence of symbolism. </p>

<p>It's nothing supernatural, it's just a question of what we store in memory and how its manifestation is context dependent.</p>

<p>This may *incidentally* bypass repression because repression comes from habits, habits that we may not have control over when asleep. But there's no active conspiracy by our &quot;subconscious&quot;.</p>

<p>Whether that's a good thing: fuck if I know.</p>
